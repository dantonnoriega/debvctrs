Description: `debkeepr` provides an interface for analyzing non-decimal
    currencies that use the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence
    through the implementation of the `lsd` class. `debkeepr` includes
    functions to apply arithmetic and financial operations to single or
    multiple values and to analyze account books that use either
    single-entry bookkeeping or double-entry bookkeeping with the latter
    providing the name for `debkeepr`.
